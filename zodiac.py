## STUDENT: CARLOS ALBERTO TRIANA BRIGANTE - ID: 21503286

#THIS PROGRAM TAKES USER ID, DATE OF BIRTH AND NAME TO MAKE A TABLE SORTED BY USER ORDER 
#AND DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT THE AGE AND ZODIAC SIGN.

#COURSEWORK 3

#We import module date, HTML and display that will help us calculating age and displaying
#the table with the data 

#We import the 're' module that will help to make regex operations to filter information 
#from .txt files
